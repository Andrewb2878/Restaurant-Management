# Restaurant-Management
Repository for the restaurant management project work (software engineering).
 Instructions on how to run it on your PC:
 Of course! Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide for someone to run your Django project on their PC after cloning it from the repository:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
First, clone the repository to their local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your team‚Äôs repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab link).

Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd <repository_folder>
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment**
It's best to work in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with global Python packages.

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Project Dependencies**
Ensure they have Python and `pip` installed. Then, install the required Python packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: Make sure your `requirements.txt` file is up-to-date and contains all the packages your project needs (e.g., Django, Pillow).

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Database**
Run Django‚Äôs migrations to set up the database schema:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Collect Static Files**
If your project uses static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images), collect them into the `staticfiles` directory:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```
> They can press `yes` (`y`) if prompted about overwriting files.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Development Server**
To run the project locally, they can start Django‚Äôs built-in development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. They can visit this URL in their browser to see the application in action.

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment Variables**
If the project uses sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials), ensure these variables are provided via a `.env` file or their operating system‚Äôs environment. For example:
- Create a `.env` file in the project root:
  ```plaintext
  SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
  DEBUG=True
  DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
  ```
- Make sure Django reads these variables using a library like `python-decouple` or `django-environ`.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Optional: Load Sample Data**
If the repository includes fixtures or sample data, they can load it into the database:
```bash
python manage.py loaddata <fixture_file.json>
```

---

### **Common Issues**
- **Dependencies Missing**: Ensure Python is updated and all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- **Database Not Configured**: Verify the database settings in `settings.py` or via environment variables.
- **Static Files Missing**: Run `collectstatic` as shown above.

---

### **Key Requirements**
Make sure to list these in your `README.md` for the repo:
1. **Python Version** (e.g., Python 3.10+ recommended).
2. **Dependencies**: `requirements.txt`.
3. Instructions for environment setup and running the server.

Let me know if you'd like help writing the `README` or refining the instructions further! üöÄ
